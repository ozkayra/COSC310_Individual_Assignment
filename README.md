# COSC310_Individual_Assignment

The individual assignment is created to show the two new features added to the Inventory System which was done as a group project in the past assignments. New features were added using API libraries found in the internet to improve the usability of the software. The first feature added into the Inventory System is the currency convertor API, and the second feature that was added is the barcode generator for the materials stored in the inventory. 

#Currency Convertor System
Currency convertor system is implemented to the Inventory System to convert the given monetary value to a desired one depending on the case. "Exchange-Rate API" website was used to get the APIkey and the URL address. After implementing those information into the code, the rest is to arrange the codd to make it available for user to use it properly.
